In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with method swizzling.  If you're not careful with the order of swizzling methods, you might accidentally override a method you need later or create infinite recursion. For instance, if you swizzle methodA with methodB, and then try to swizzle methodB with methodA without proper safeguards, you could end up in a loop where each method keeps calling the other.

Example of problematic swizzling:

```objectivec
Method originalMethodA = class_getInstanceMethod([MyClass class], @selector(methodA));
Method swizzledMethodA = class_getInstanceMethod([MyClass class], @selector(mySwizzledMethodA));
method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethodA, swizzledMethodA);

Method originalMethodB = class_getInstanceMethod([MyClass class], @selector(methodB));
Method swizzledMethodB = class_getInstanceMethod([MyClass class], @selector(mySwizzledMethodB));
method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethodB, swizzledMethodB); // This might cause issues if not handled correctly, depending on the implementation of methodA and methodB
```
